			PUGB is a battle royale game built and published by PUGB Corporation. The game is based on a few Arma mods and H1Z1. In this multiplayer game, an individual player along with 99 other real-time players are all taken to a remote island that has been abandoned by its inhabitants. The goal of the game is for the player to eliminate the competition using any means necessary and be the last person standing. PUBG is currently one of the most played games in the world and is available on several platforms including Xbox One, PC, Android, and iOS.

				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps. The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground. Players start with no gear. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match. Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time. This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.
    			At the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance. The currency is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon customization. A rotating "event mode" was added to the game in March 2018. These events change up the normal game rules, such as establishing larger teams or squads, or altering the distribution of weapons and armor across the game map.</p>
