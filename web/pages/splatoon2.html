			Splatoon 2, the sequel to Platoon, is a colorful team-based multiplayer shooter game that brings something unusual to the shooter genre. It was created and published by Nintendo and is available exclusively on the Nintendo Switch. Players are required to ink everything visible in an attempt to spread colors over the whole map area.

				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Splatoon 2 is a third-person shooter in which players control characters, known as Inklings and Octolings, and use colored ink as ammunition. Ink is also used to cover the ground, or any paintable surface, in order to swim or refill their ink tanks. Inklings and Octolings can morph between humanoid, or kid form, where they switch from walking, and shooting, into squid form where they can quickly swim through ink of their own color, and replenish their ink supply, as well as return to full health.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Once per month until July 2019, a "Splatfest" event was held in which players could choose one of two teams, usually based on common debates such as heroes versus villains and pancakes versus waffles. In addition, there were two collaborations during these Splatfests: Nickelodeon's Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Splatfest themes were usually announced one week in advance, and players were given the ability to choose their team in the game's lobby. Themes were usually region-specific and happen at different times of the month. Splatfest battles were Turf Wars only, but players could choose between normal and pro modes. Winning battles awarded 'clout' to the winning team, and at the end of the Splatfest, the winning side was decided by evaluating popularity and clout earned in both battle modes. All players who participate earn rare rewards, but players who chose the winning team receive a slightly higher cut.</p>

				<p>
				The game features a single-player campaign called Hero Mode, in which the player rescues captured Zapfish across various levels while fighting off evil Octarians. Unlike the previous game's single-player campaign which had a pre-determined weapon set, the player can now earn various weapons, some of which are required when playing levels for the first time. In addition to Sunken Scrolls that unlock artwork and in-game lore, players can collect Sardinium to upgrade their Hero Mode weapons, and tickets that can be exchanged for temporary reward boosts in multiplayer battles, such as increased experience or in-game money.</p>
