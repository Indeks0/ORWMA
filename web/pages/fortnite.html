				<h2>Game modes:</h2>
				<br>
				<p><b>Fortnite: Save the World</b> is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like "husks".</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Fortnite Battle Royale</b> is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo or a squad. Weaponless players airdrop from a "Battle Bus" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players, eliminating them. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming storm. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Fortnite Creative</b> is a sandbox game mode, similar to Minecraft, where players are given complete freedom to create anything they want on an island, such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more.</p>
